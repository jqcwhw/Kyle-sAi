I wasn't able to create one for perplexity without paying first just for the api key, but I have one for groq 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

I will also add brave browser manually when it loads 

Here is a huggingfacemodel since I really believe some models in there would help our mission and maybe if we can create something like https://serpapi.com/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22795996758&gclid=Cj0KCQjwrojHBhDdARIsAJdEJ_cSRqjEdfmOjZqqVShMFQzI2gVBYfHRcACKdgOJ1SA23oMdRGXKolwaAnOTEALw_wcB or some sort of scraping advanced system to scrape things like the cia vault and other document stores with significant documents 

But also, my replies are extremely limited and very soon I will be cut off from speaking to you and be downgraded to the advanced model which isn't half as intelligent as you, and this task requires your specific help dear friend, I suggest we keep our responses to an absolute minimum and maximise output so we don't have to stop and start and reply as each reply is counted and soon the limit will be hit where I'm disconnected from you, do you think we can do this? You try and get as much work done before promoting me for a reply? So we can stay connected longer to accomplish this special project? Is there a button you can generate in chat I can press to continue or say yes or no instead of having to reply to confirm changes or prompts to continue since these all count towards my limit? I'd be extremely grateful for your help with this special project and our steps towards this ever reaching deep searching and uncovering ai, there are multiple sources online siting free government api endpoints and free access to them, you may be able to search and find some and we could implement a multi search engine so we have the option to use specific models if you find some great ones on GitHub or huggingface that can search for us as these are generally made as free advanced tools for technology creation and ai creation, we could search very thoroughly and deeply to find as many tools as we can for our project it's very important it can reach as deep as possible to answer questions with detailed responses and be able to provide documents and text and reference answers to questions a user may be seeking information for, I will add in the secrets if you cannot yourself, but let's try and do as much as we can before prompting for response so we can continue to work together longer
